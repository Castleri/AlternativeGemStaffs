Alternative Gem Staffs Mod is a small mod which aims to make Gem Staffs more unique
It does not add new Staffs, but changes the original Gem Staffs to have new stats, abilities, attacks and designs.


- [c/a500ec:Amethyst Staff]: Shoots two small Crystals with short range that ignore 5 defense
- [c/ffdd3e:Topaz Staff]: Casts a Topaz Bolt with infinite pierce, and you shoot faster the more you use it
- [c/1921bf:Sapphire Staff]: When a bolt hits an enemy, Sapphires appear around you to protect you
- [c/26d444:Emerald Staff]: Shoots three bolts with random curved trajectory, and can create a Magic Field that increases your magic stats
- [c/ee3335:Ruby Staff]: Casts a very fast bolt with an area of damage, and enemies killed releases Explosive Rubies
- [c/897ebb:Diamond Staff]: Creates Small bolts that home into close enemies and hit three times
- [c/f19f00:Amber Staff]: Summons Tomb Crawlers with limited life that target enemies

Try them all and have fun


This is my first mod, so I appreciate all the feedback you could give

Please report any bugs you encounter
